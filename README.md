# DataWarehouse and Business Intelligence reporting for Fudgemart-Fudgeflix
Built a datawarehouse and ETL project for fictional clients Fudgemart and Fudgeflix

# Goal of the project
Fudgemart and Fudgeflix are two fictional clients which are similar to Walmart and Fudgeflix. They have been experiencing a decline in sales so the end goal will be to analyze the sales for them to identify trends or patterns in their sales.
The project utilizes SSIS for the ETL process where the data is extracted from the database, transformed where all the data is made into a conistent format and then loaded into a data warehouse. 
After the ETL process, I have used Power BI to design dashboards for Fudge Corporation and provide actionable insights to the team.
The steps involved in the project are as follows:
1. Project Charter for defining the project
2. Data Profiling for understanding the data
3. High-Level Dimensional Modeling
4. Detailed Dimension Modeling
5. ROLAP Bus Architecture in MS SQL Server
6. ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load in SSIS)
7. Using MOLAP cubes for creating dashboards in Power BI
